Music Recommendation System

This repository contains a project for developing a music recommendation system similar to Spotify's. The system predicts a user's likelihood of repeatedly listening to a song within a set timeframe (one month) using machine learning techniques.
Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a personalized music recommendation system that tracks user song histories and generates tailored song recommendations. The key steps involved in this project include data collection, preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and deployment.
Key Features

    Data Collection: Using the Spotify API to gather user listening history and song metadata.
    Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming raw data to create useful features.
    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distributions and identifying patterns.
    Model Building: Implementing machine learning algorithms to predict repeated plays.
    Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using various metrics.
    Integration and Testing: Integrating the model into a simple application and testing its functionality.
    Deployment: Deploying the application on a server or cloud platform.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes user listening histories with timestamps and other metadata. A binary indicator is created to denote whether a song was played repeatedly within a month.
Libraries and Tools

    numpy
    pandas
    seaborn
    matplotlib
    scikit-learn
    
Results

The system provides personalized song recommendations based on user listening patterns, aiming to enhance the user experience by suggesting tracks that are likely to be played repeatedly.

Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques in building a music recommendation system. By leveraging user listening data and song metadata, the system can provide valuable recommendations that cater to individual preferences.
